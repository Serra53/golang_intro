# Notes
go interfaces are different from other langauges. In Go, interfaces are a custom type that is used to specify a set of one or more method signatures. Interfaces are abstract, you cannot instanciate an interface. But you are allowed to create a variable of an interface type and this variable can be assigned with a concrete type.



- interfaces are not generic types
- interfaces are implicit
- interfaces are a contract to help us manage types
